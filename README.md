# .NET Core
## Building Microservices with .NET Core 2.0
Architect your .NET applications by breaking them into really small pieces—microservices—using this practical, example-based guide

# What is this book about?

The microservices architectural style promotes the development of complex applications as a suite of small services based on business capabilities. This book will help you identify the appropriate service boundaries within your business. The book starts by looking at what microservices are and their main characteristics.
Moving forward, you will be introduced to real-life application scenarios; after assessing the current issues, you will begin the journey of transforming this application by splitting it into a suite of microservices using C# 7.0 with .NET Core 2.0. You will identify service boundaries, split the application into multiple microservices, and define service contracts. You will find out how to configure, deploy, and monitor microservices, and configure scaling to allow the application to quickly adapt to increased demand in the future.
With an introduction to reactive microservices, you’ll strategically gain further value to keep your code base simple, focusing on what is more important rather than on messy asynchronous calls.
